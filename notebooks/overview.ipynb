    "## Data Processing Overview\n",
    "For more exact details, please see [initial_base_data_exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/blob/main/notebooks/initial_base_data_exploration.ipynb) and [`HDialogueParser.py`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/blob/main/scripts/HDialogueParser.py). Regardless, my processing can be outlined in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Fork van Stegeren's [original repository](https://github.com/hmi-utwente/video-game-text-corpora).\n",
    "2. Extract the three datasets from there.\n",
    "3. Clean them up, extracting and reformatting the datasets as needed.\n",
    "4. Save them to `.pkl` files, creating sample `.pkl` files as well.\n",
    "5. Use `HDialogueParser.py` to extract the dialogue from _Hollow Knight_.\n",
    "6. Clean up its DataFrame likewise.\n",
    "7. Save to `.pkl` likewise.\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "After looking more deeply at the data, I have now formed more well-rounded and established questions that I want to try to answer. Some questions pertain to a specific dataset while others will be (hopefully) answered using some combination of some or all the datasets. They are as follows:\n",
    "1. How are orders/requests realized in video game dialogues? Are there more direct or indirect orders?\n",
    "2. What is the frequency of the 2nd person pronoun, _you_? \n",
    "    * Extending that, what are the frequencies of other pronouns?\n",
    "3. What are some common named entities in video games?\n",
    "    * Extending this, what are some hapaxes related to named entities?\n",

    "### Game Summary\n",
    "_Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic_ is a 2003 single-player role-playing game released by _Bioware_ and published through _LucasArts_. The player plays as Revan and traverses the _Star Wars_ univerise during the age of the Old Republic (set before the prequel trilogy). This game is commonly abbreviated as _KOTOR_/_Kotor_, and as such, further mentions of this game in this and other notebooks/markdown files will follow suit.\n",
    "### Data Summary\n",
    "This dataset was comprised of two `.csv` files: one containing the actual dialogue, and the other containing metadata regarding the animations which the characters did during the dialogue. For context, game developers usually employ a set amount of animations which all/most character models can do. This allows them to mass-apply certain animations throughout the game and save time and development costs. Each entry contains the following for `kotor.pkl`:\n",
    "* `speaker`: The speaker of the dialogue.\n",
    "* `listener`: Who is being directly addressed by the speaker. This serves as important sociolinguistic information.\n",
    "* `text`: What the speaker says in text format.\n",
    "* `word_count`: The text's word count (according to `nltk.word_tokenize`).\n",
    "* `animation`: A Python List of animations which play during the dialogue.\n",
    "* `next`: A Python List of the next chunks of dialogue which occur.\n",
    "* `previous`: A Python List of the previous chunks of dialogue which occurred in that cutscene/instance.\n",
    "* `comment`: Comment(s) left by the developers in the in-game text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry for the metadata file `meta_kotor.pkl` contains the following:\n",
    "* `name`: Animation name.\n",
    "* `looping`: Can/does this animation loop.\n",
    "* `fireforget`: I am waiting for clarification from the original repository's creator, the one who made the dataset, but I believe this indicates whether or not this animation cancels the NPC being in the attack state.\n",
    "* `dialog`: Is this a dialogue animation (can this play during dialogue).\n",
    "* `cu_pb_range`: Another one I am unsure of. I believe this either relates to the time duration of the animation (in seconds), or the time it takes to transition into the animation from another animation (in seconds).\n",

    "## Hollow Knight Overview\n",
    "### Game Summary\n",
    "_Hollow Knight_ is a [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania#:~:text=Metroidvania%20is%20a%20subgenre%20of,genre%20borrowing%20from%20both%20series.) styled game made by _Team Cherry_ and released early 2017. The player controls _The Knight_ as they make their way through the dark fantasy world. What's interesting about this game is that it was made by 3 people, with the writing being done by 2 of those individuals in a Google Doc. So, I believe this will be an amazing dataset to explore the differences between professional video game writing and amateur writing (although the writing is still good nonetheless).\n",
    "### Data Summary\n",
    "I gathered the data from a fan-made [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaED7I6xL5NItD-wKyDB455f58d3weLz8OMIkRyEQlo/edit#heading=h.wgd1af4mikjx) containing every single textual item in the game. I don't know why they did that as I know they did it completely by hand. The document is over 200 pages long and extremely well-formatted. I used [`HDialogueParser.py`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/blob/main/scripts/HDialogueParser.py) with the following techniques:\n",
    "1. Copy the original Google Document, simplifying the non-textual and header elements. Get both an `.html` and `.txt` version.\n",
    "2. Use `beautifulsoup` to parse the `.html` file, getting the characters and main descriptions from each section.\n",
    "3. Use the `.txt` file to create a tagged-style annotated `.txt` file which was then used to create the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry contains the following:\n",
    "* `character`: The character's name.\n",
    "* `text`: A text dump of all the character's dialogue, split into chunks via description tags. However, there can be further sub-descriptions in each part. I am... **extremely** familiar with this dataset, so I am able to tell what is dialogue and what is a sub-description (although, in general, it's pretty obvious). Therefore, I recommend only people familiar with the game use this dataset. You may also refer to the original Google Document to see what is and isn't a subdescription.\n",
    "* `word_count`: The text's word count (according to `nltk.word_tokenize`).\n",

    "## Additional Notes:\n",
    "All datasets will be used in the answering of my research questions. However, here are some highlights regarding each question and some hypothesis/guesses with the datasets.\n",
    "1. For this question, the _Hollow Knight_, _Torchlight II_, and _Kotor_ datasets will be perfect for this (also _The Dishonored Series_ if I can get it). _The Elder Scrolls_ data contains actual books published in-game, so I don't expect to get much out of them, if anything with this question. I hypothesize that the majority of discourse in-game involved the player in some way, shape, or form. I also hypothesize that **all** dialogue is tailored to help the player or immerse the player.\n",
    "2. All datasets will be useful here. However, I suspect much dialogue writing can be thought of as a template:\n",
    "    I need {x item}, but {y boss/creature} is guarding it. Can you help me?\n",
    "Or something similar. \n",
    "3. I suspect general world-building text/dialogue is more free form and less restricted to its genre. I also suspect there to be sociolinguistic trends when certain characters speak/write.\n",
    "4. I already know this one is true, but it will be nice to capture it with real data. In particular, with _The Elder Scrolls_ series, the games' \"races\" all derive heavily from real-world cultures. There is also a very obvious set of linguistic traits associated with one of these races that are explained with pseudo-linguistics. These traits show up in the books written by that race. I am going to have a lot of fun with this one.\n",
    "5. I hope I can make meaning comparisons between the _Hollow Knight_ dataset against all the other datasets in some way. I hypothesize that the dialogue written in _Hollow Knight_ is much more directed towards the player with very little non-player-related dialogue due to the game's genre and team size. I might also suspect the quality of the writing differs, but I am unsure how to meaningully compare it when all groups involved are native English speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think these datasets and games will be perfect for the questions I am trying to answer. I expect my end-game data to be mostly examples of certain discourse/pragmatic features gotten from the DataFrames and charts highlighting trends in each DataFrame (word counts relating to quest type, trends in hapaxes frequency, etc). This project is definitely going to be analysis heavy, but I also don't expect there to be too many graphs, being more focused on case studies and comparisons within the datasets."
