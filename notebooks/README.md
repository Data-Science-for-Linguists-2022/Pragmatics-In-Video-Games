This subdirectory contains the primary research and exploratory "pokes" of the data via _Jupyter_ notebook files. In particular, the following notebooks can be found:
- `initial_base_data_exploration.ipynb`: Where I take the original data gotten from both my `HDialogueparser.py` script and the [_Video Game Text Corpora_](https://github.com/hmi-utwente/video-game-text-corpora) repository and clean then up for my intended use cases. I also create the data located in [`sample_data`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/tree/main/sample_data) (for the most part).
- `overview.ipynb`: An extremely brief notebook detailing information regarding to each of the games and their respectice dataframes. Some slight modifications to the data were made here (column names).
- `research.ipynb`: This is the main notebook, containing the primary exploratory-focused research I conducted over the Spring 2022 Semester of [Data Science for Linguists](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022). It is also where I created the `entities.pkl` Dataframe.

**NOTE:** For anyone who finds this repository, please tell me what you think via email! This was my first big project which involved both linguistics and computer science. While it may not be much, I am extremely proud of the work I done and I hope I and anyone else interested are able to use what's here to extend what I've research as well as form new research.
