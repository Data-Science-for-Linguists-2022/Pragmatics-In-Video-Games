## Summary
This repository seeks to explore the following avenues:
1. How are orders/requests realized in video game dialogues? Are there more direct or indirect orders?
2. What is the frequency of the 2nd person pronoun, _you_? 
    * Extending that, what are the frequencies of other pronouns?
3. Are hapaxes a common occurrence in video games?
    * Extending this, what named entity types are common?

**PLEASE NOTE** I am only publishing a sample of my dataset, including the full data of any video game texts I parse myself. However, the original repository this research is based on can be found [here](https://github.com/hmi-utwente/video-game-text-corpora).

## Overview
### Folders
* [`sample_data`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/tree/main/sample_data) contains sample datasets used in this research. Any dataset originally made by me is in full, this includes: [`hollow_sample.pkl`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/blob/main/sample_data/hollow_sample.pkl).
* [`scripts`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/tree/main/scripts) contains any full `.py` scripts I made during this research, mostly parsers. Some might not have been used (... or completed...).
* [`notebooks`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/tree/main/notebooks) contains any `.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook files I made during this research. As well as two Python packages ([`notebook_funcs`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/tree/main/notebooks/notebook_funcs) and [`specific_funcs`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/tree/main/notebooks/specific_funcs)) used throughout the main [`research.ipynb`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games/tree/main/notebooks/research.ipynb) notebook.
