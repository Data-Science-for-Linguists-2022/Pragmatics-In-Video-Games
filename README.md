## Summary
This repository seeks to explore the following avenues:
1. How are order/requests realized in video game quest dialogues? Are there more direct or indirect orders?
2. What is the frequency of the 2nd person pronoun, _you_? Extending that, what are the frequencies of other pronouns and pro-verbs?
3. Are hapaxes a common occurrence and what are their purpose(s) in video games?
