## Summary
This project is about the evolution of video game writing over the decades. This project's goal is to not only analyze how video game writing has changed since its early foundations, but also highlight how said writing is influenced by the game's genre and how fantasy games in particular use certain sociolinguistic phenomena to their advantage.
