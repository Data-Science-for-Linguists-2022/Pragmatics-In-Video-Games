## Summary
This repository seeks to answer the following questions:
1. How do video game pragmatics and discourse differ from their real life counterparts? 
    * Does the player being the central figure drastically affect how they are realized?
    * What (if any) techniques do video game writers employ which are different from other forms of writing?
    * _Hypothesis_: Deictic words are infrequent when text/dialogue involves quests or objectives. This could be because writers want to make sure a player knows the objective.
3. Do writers of fantasy video games take into consideration sociolinguistic elements such as dialect, culture, identity, region, etc. when writing their characters? If so, how?
4. Expanding upon question 3, are those considerations "realistic"; in other words, do writers commit pseudo-linguistics when trying to write for fantasy cultures? (e.g. "This fantasy culture talks like this because they cannot understand the first person" or something).
5. Are there differences between professional video game writers, and "indie" (low-budget, small studio) video game writers?
