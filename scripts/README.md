The scripts are as follows:
- `brown_deictic_extractor.py`: **FAILURE** Abandonded extractor for original plan (look at deictic words). Deemed too complicated.
- `HDialogueParser.py`: Dual-text parser used to extract and tag the text from the [Hollow Knight Fan Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17zFS-WaLwkEw-4UV3ByH2SCmkAjQHHRY5_izHbdKSdI/edit?usp=sharing).
- `test_orders_requests.py`: Partially how I tested my _spaCy Matcher_ and regex expressions. `Pytest` script, run by doing `pytest` in your CLI.
